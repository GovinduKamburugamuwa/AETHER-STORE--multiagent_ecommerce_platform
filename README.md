# AETHER STORE (Multi-Agent E-Commerce Platform)

AETHER STORE is an innovative e-commerce platform that goes beyond traditional concepts by implementing a multi-agent system. It uses specialized autonomous agents to manage various aspects of the platform, such as customer interactions, product recommendations, inventory, and feedback analysis. This decentralized approach optimizes operations, enhances user experiences, and ensures scalability.


## Ontology in the AETHER STORE MAS

The AETHER STORE Multi-Agent E-Commerce Platform aims to simulate the functioning of an advanced e-commerce system using an ontology-based approach. The ontology captures the core entities, their relationships, and behaviors within the system, such as customers, products, orders, agents, and tasks. By using an ontology, the platform allows for efficient reasoning, data sharing, and task management across different agents, ensuring that they can work collaboratively to optimize the e-commerce processes.
